DfAnalyzer tool
</h3>
      <p>
      DfAnalyzer tool is an instantiation of ARMFUL architecture to provide dataflow analysis to scientific applications. By coupling DfAnalyzer components to the source code of scientific applications, raw data is extracted and related along a dataflow ready for queries at runtime. DfAnalyzer has features that help monitoring, debugging, provenance registration and steering, all at runtime. Its light components do not harm the parallel performance of the scientific applications. As opposed to SWMS, DfAnalyzer keeps all the parallel execution control at the scientific application code. Threfore, applications may use highly efficient libraries or invoke black-box parallel code. However, DfAnalyzer can also be used by SWMS developers, so that they can incorporate user steering support. Considering the ARMFUL’s components, the following table shows how each one of them is mapped to DfAnalyzer:

DfAnalyzer programs

<h4>
Provenance Data Gatherer
</h4>
    <p>
    Provenance Data Gatherer (PG) program manages dataflow at physical (i.e., file flow) and logical (i.e., data flow) levels. PG captures provenance and domain-specific data from scientific application code or a SWMS, generating a JSON file with the gatherer data and their dependencies. We highlight that the generated JSON files by PG presents a hierarchical structure to be in accordance with the dataflow concepts presented in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.3616/abstract" target="_blank">our CCPE paper</a> published in 2016. 
    </p>
    <p>
    More information about PG can be found <a href="https://github.com/hpcdb/armful/tree/gh-pages/src/dfanalyzer/pg" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

<h4>
Raw Data Extractor
</h4>
    <p>
    Before to gather domain-specific data using PG program, users have to access and extract raw data from files. Therefore, Raw Data Extractor (RDE) program can be used to provide raw data extraction from files. To run this program, users have to define the following input arguments: 
    <ul>
        <li>
        Name of the raw data extractor;
        </li>
        <li>
        Directory where raw data files can be found;
        </li>
        <li>
        Raw data files that have to be investigated;
        </li>
        <li>
        Attributes (i.e., raw data contents) that have to be accessed and extracted from the raw data files; and
        </li>
        <li>
        Cartridge for raw data extraction.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Since different cartridges can be developed in ARMFUL, users are able to change the extraction algorithm according to their file format or other issues. Considering these input arguments, RDE program access each raw data file each time and extract the values of the selected attributes. All extracted raw data (from several files) are stored in an output file, which follows a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file format with a header (i.e., selected attributes). 
    </p>
    <p>
    More information about RDE can be found <a href="https://github.com/hpcdb/armful/tree/gh-pages/src/dfanalyzer/rde" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

<h4>
Raw Data Indexer
</h4>
    <p>
    Besides the raw data extraction, there are some approaches that index raw data from files to reduce the volume of data to be loaded into an external repository or a database system, such as <a href="https://sdm.lbl.gov/fastbit/" target="_blank">FastBit</a>, <a href="http://stratos.seas.harvard.edu/publications/nodb-efficient-query-execution-raw-data-files-0" target="_blank">NoDB</a>, <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200346/files/raw.pdf" target="_blank">RAW</a>, and <a href="https://sdm.lbl.gov/~sbyna/research/papers/2013-PDSW2013-SDS.pdf" target="_blank">SDS/Q</a>. Raw Data Indexer (RDI) has the same input arguments of RDE program, however this program generates indexes to the accessed raw data from files. RDI program presents some cartridges that use existing approaches, such as FastBit tool. This program also has a cartridge based on the positional indexing, which considers the RAW’s implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
    More information about RDI can be found <a href="https://github.com/hpcdb/armful/tree/gh-pages/src/dfanalyzer/rdi" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

<h4>
Data Ingestor
</h4>
    <p>
    Once provenance and raw data have been gathered by PG program, Data Ingestor (DI) has to be initialized to store provenance data and extracted/indexed raw data from files into a relational database. Thus, this program initialize a database server to perform those store operations into the database. In addition, this relational database follows our PROV-Df data model, which is PROV-compliant. 
    </p>
    <p>
    More details about DI can be found <a href="https://github.com/hpcdb/armful/tree/gh-pages/src/dfanalyzer/di" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

<h4>
Query Processor
</h4>
    <p>
    Since provenance and raw data are already stored in a relational database, Query Processor (QP) can be invoked to query those stored data. This program consumes as input arguments the database connection properties and a SQL-based query. QP aims at performing a database connection and running this specified query. Therefore, QP has to identify which attributes have to be queried from provenance tables and which attributes are related to domain-specific data (raw data extracted/indexed from files).
    </p>
    <p>
    More details about QP program can be found <a href="https://github.com/hpcdb/armful/tree/gh-pages/src/dfanalyzer/qp" target="_blank">here</a>.
