ARMFUL architecture
</h3>
      <p>
      ARMFUL is a component-based architecture that enables the Analysis of Raw data from Multiple Files. ARMFUL analyzes scientific data by retrieving raw data from files and relating them through dataflow provenance data. We use a relational database to manage provenance and raw data to benefit from its analytical query support in dataflows. In addition, Database Management Systems (DBMS) present well-known algorithms and strategies to guarantee atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability in transactions, while they also have consolidated solutions for enabling concurrency control and recovery. To support raw data analysis, the following services are provided by ARMFUL during the execution of scientific applications:
      <ul>
        <li>
        access to raw data files while they are being generated;
        </li>
        <li>
        parse raw data to find relevant data;
        </li>
        <li>
        extract relevant subsets of raw data;
        </li>
        <li>
        index over data regions of interest;
        </li>
        <li>
        prepare raw data for queries; and
        </li>
        <li>
        runtime query relating raw data from different files, provenance data, and performance execution data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

Components
</h3>
  <p>
  ARMFUL architecture presents the following three components, as presented in Figure 1: <i>Provenance Data Gathering</i>, <i>Raw Data Extraction</i>, and <i>Index Generation</i>. In the same way as Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWMS) with provenance support, white components correspond to the capture of provenance data and their storage in a provenance database. <i>Provenance Data Gathering</i> component aims at capturing provenance data and execution metadata generated during the parallel execution of scientific workflows, and storing those gathered data in a provenance relational database. The provenance relational database follows a data model that presents the pointers to the raw data files and metadata that represent raw data contents, which should be extracted from files to support raw data analysis.  Our PROV-compliant data model is presented in Figure 2 and more information about it can be found <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.3616/abstract" target="_blank">here</a>.

  Gray components describe the steps to extract raw data from files, to generate indexes over the raw data, and to query provenance and raw data from a database. To support raw data analysis, <i>Provenance Data Gathering</i> component manages the relationships among files, since <i>Raw Data Extraction</i> and <i>Index Generation</i> components need the file references to access and extract raw data from files. Moreover, they enable queries that associate raw data elements from multiple files. Following, we discuss each one of these gray components in detail.</p>
  <p>
  <i>Raw Data Extraction</i> component aims at reading the contents of raw data files, parsing them and retrieving selected contents that are relevant according to the attributes chosen by the user. To achieve this goal, this component follows four steps: content read, tokenization, contents filtering, and parsing. More details about those steps can be found in [REF PAPER ARMFUL].
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>Index Generation</i> component is responsible for indexing specific contents from files to improve direct access to specific regions of the raw data space and managing metadata associated to the dataflow. Besides the content read from raw data files and parsing, <i>Index Generation</i> has to create indexes to the accessed raw data contents according to the defined indexing algorithm.
  </p>
  <p> 
  <i>Query Processing</i> provides a mechanism to query provenance and raw data stored in our provenance database. This component varies its behavior according to the chosen strategy for extracting or indexing raw data from files. More details about the behavior of this component can be found in [REF PAPER ARMFUL].

Instantiation of ARMFUL architecture
</h3>
  <p>
  <b>A-Chiron SWMS</b>
  </p>
  <p>A-Chiron is an implementation of ARMFUL with Chiron SWMS. Since the main contributions of ARMFUL are supporting raw data extraction and index generation based on the invocation of external programs (ad-hoc programs or third-party tools), we developed different cartridges to support these features in A-Chiron. More details about this implementation can be found <a href="a-chiron.html">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>DfAnalyzer framework</b>
  </p>
  <p>Considering the components from ARMFUL architecture, we instantiate them as DfAnalyzer to be coupled to existing SWMS and scientific applications. DfAnalyzer framework keeps all the parallel execution control at the code of the SWMS or the scientific application. We present more details about DfAnalyzer <a href="dfanalyzer.html" >here</a>.
